REACT NOTES

SETTING UP ENVIRONMENT
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app desired-directory-name

IMPORTING THE PROPER FUNCTIONALITY

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css'

NOTE: I think if you import the css file, you might not need to link it to your html page. I'm not sure but I think this is correct.

SCRIPTS: Note that your package.json file contains multiple react scripts that already come included with it. I don't know what they all mean but I'll come up with theories for now.

  START: I believe the start script creates a server for you and opens your page in your browser.

INSTALLING LANGUAGE-BABEL USING ATOM: apm install language-babel.
