BABEL'S PURPOSE: This is one of the most popular transpilers, meaning transpilers are in charge of changing code syntax into code that all browsers can read.
  A great example of this is es6 which is the new js format. You can use babel, and it'll transpile your code and turn it into raw es5 which runs in all browsers.

  INSTALLATION:
    npm install babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev

    npm install babel-preset-stage-0 --save-dev

      Apparently this code is meant to allow you to use es7, but I don't know enough details about it.

    npm install babel-preset-react --save-dev

      I don't know what the react preset does, but I'll find out soon enough.
